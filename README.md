The 2tonnes workshop invites participants to explore the future in teams and try to limit climate change by reaching the 2tonnes per year per person by 2050.

To allow a systemic understanding of the issues, the workshop takes into account the individual and collective dimensions of the subject, without forgetting the role of influence, a key issue in the transformation of society.

Aimed at both novices and experts on the subject of climate change, it is also a real serious game, designed to bring people together and debate together, so that everyone can have fun and express their opinions.

Have you always dreamed of putting yourself in the shoes of a Minister, or talking about the climate with Donald Trump? Take part in the game!

Your goal is ambitious, but your budget is limited! Will you be able to make the right choices?
